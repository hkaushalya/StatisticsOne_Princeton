    "contents" : "#week 9 quiz\n\n# This week, we turn to a classic study on helping behavior by Darley\n# and Batson (1973). Simulated data are provided here. The study \n# demonstrates that people’s likelihood of helping a person in distress \n# depends largely on their level of haste—whether they were running early, \n# on time, or late for an appointment—when they encounter him, rather than \n# on whether they have been asked to reflect on a pro-helping message (the\n# parable of the Good Samaritan) as opposed to a neutral message (occupational\n# effectiveness). In this dataset, independent variables include\n# Prime (1 = parable of the Good Samaritan; 2 = occupational effectiveness)\n# and Haste (1 = early, 2 = on time, 3 = late). On their way to a nearby \n# location, participants encounter a moaning individual in distress. \n# The Helping variable provides a measure of how much they help, ranging \n# from 0 to 6 with higher scores indicating greater helping.\n\nrm(list=ls())\nlibrary(psych)\ndf <- read.table('Stats1.13.HW.09.txt', header=T)\nstr(df)\nsummary(df)\nhead(df)\n\n# Question 1\n# What is the class of Haste and Prime in R?\nclass(df$Prime)\nclass(df$Haste)\n\n# Question 2\n# After converting Haste and Prime to factors, run an ANOVA with both Haste\n# and Prime as independent variables.
